        "Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemma have been shown to be effective at a variety of NLP tasks. An LLM is first pre-trained on a large corpus of text in a self-supervised fashion. Pre-training helps LLMs learn general-purpose knowledge, such as statistical relationships between words. An LLM can then be fine-tuned with domain-specific data to perform downstream tasks (such as sentiment analysis).\n",

        "\n",
        "LLMs are extremely large in size (parameters in the order of billions). Full fine-tuning (which updates all the parameters in the model) is not required for most applications because typical fine-tuning datasets are relatively much smaller than the pre-training datasets.\n",

This makes training with LoRA much faster and more memory-efficient, and produces smaller model weights (a few hundred MBs), all while maintaining the quality of the model outputs.\n",

Train your model with this rank and evaluate the performance improvement on your task. Gradually increase the rank in subsequent trials and see if that further boosts performance."

            "                    Blood tests. Blood tests are done to check for certain viruses and other substances in the blood. The following types of blood tests are used in the diagnosis of viral infections with neurological symptoms:         -   Antibody blood test (serologic test): This type of blood test checks for antibodies (proteins made by the immune system to fight infection) in the blood. The test detects antibodies that are made by the immune system in response to a certain virus. The results can indicate if a person has had a past infection with a certain virus and how recently the infection occurred.    -   Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test: This type of blood test can be done on a blood sample or a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. In an ELISA test, the blood sample is placed in a test plate and allowed to react with a substance from the virus. A substance from the virus that was detected during the blood test is attached to the test plate. The antibody in the blood sample reacts with the\n"
