![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73c6d8fe-b640-4131-99f5-8d4254fe2d66)

Overview
This repository hosts the Gemma Medical QA Model, a fine-tuned model specifically designed for answering medical-related questions with accuracy and reliability. Built upon the Gemma2_2B architecture, this model has been fine-tuned using LoRA with separate training sessions on Google Colab and Kaggle. This setup enables efficient use of computational resources and provides optimized performance for medical question answering.

Setup & Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code

git clone https://github.com/oluwafemidiakhoa/Finetuned.git
cd Finetuned

Install necessary dependencies (TensorFlow, Transformers, etc.):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Load the model on Kaggle (or download it locally for other environments).

Usage
To use the model for medical question answering, follow these steps:

Load the Model:

python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the model
model_path = "/path/to/model"
model = tf.keras.models.load_model(model_path)
Prepare Input: Format your question input as required by the model, including any preprocessing or tokenization if necessary.

Run Inference:

python
Copy code
question = "What are the symptoms of hypertension?"
processed_question = preprocess_question(question)  # Ensure any required preprocessing
answer = model.predict(processed_question)
print("Answer:", answer)
Model Training and Fine-Tuning
The model was fine-tuned in two separate training sessions:

Google Colab Session:
Data: 1,300 examples
TPU enabled for efficient training
Kaggle Session:
Data: 3,000 examples
NVIDIA A100 GPU utilized for performance
Training Script
If you wish to fine-tune or retrain the model, follow the training script in train.py (include if applicable).

Limitations
Not a Replacement for Professional Medical Advice: This model is intended for educational purposes and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical guidance.
Data Constraints: Although trained on 4,300 examples, performance may vary on less common or highly specialized medical topics.
Inference Cost: May require TPU or GPU for optimal performance, especially for larger inputs or batch processing.
